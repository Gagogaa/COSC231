<h1>Gengar</h1>

<h2>Evolutionary line</h2>

	<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gastly_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><img src="pictures/092Gastly.png" alt="Gastly" /></a>
	<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Haunter_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><img src="pictures/093Haunter.png" alt="Haunter" /></a>
	<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gengar_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><img src="pictures/600px-094Gengar.png" alt="Gengar" /></a>
	<p>The first pokemon in Gengar's chain of evolution is Gastly (the left or top most pokemon). Gastly is a little spherical blip of poisonous 
		gas that plays pranks on people. It evolves into Haunter at level 25. Haunter (the center most pokemon) is kinda like Gastly but not 
		spherical and possesses a pair disembodied hands. Haunter also likes playing pranks on people and it evolves into Gengar when it's traded.
		Gengar(!) the right or bottom most mass of dark purple awesomeness has a pair of red eyes, large pointed ears, and a wide sinister grin. 
		Some other similar pokemon include Alakazam, Misdreavus, and Dusknoir.</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>
<p>Gengars abilities are awesome! Gengars ability to fly through the air mixed with a vaporous body makes it immune to ground, normal, 
	and fighting type attacks. Gengar can hid perfectly in the shadow of any object lending it amazing stealth abilities. Gengar can learn 
	<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gengar_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Learnset">large variety of moves</a> giving it move sets strong enough
	to deal with any team.</p>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<p>Gengar is weak to <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gengar_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Type_effectiveness">
	Ghost, Psychic, and Dark</a> type attacks making the list of similar pokemon (Alakazam, Misdreavus, and Dusknoir) extremely dangerous. 
	tread with care friends (or just have Gengar hide in the shadows).</p>

<h2>Trivia</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Gengar could be seen as a counterpart to Alakazam. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary family, which can only be achieved by trading the second stage, both are capable of Mega Evolution, Gengar is weak against Psychic-type moves and Alakazam weak against Ghost-type moves, thus being weak and at the same time strong against each other. They are the same size, and get smaller upon Mega Evolution, sharing a base friendship is the same at 70. In the anime episode The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis, a Gengar and an Alakazam are put against each other. Since Generation VI, they have a base stat total of 500, and are both weak to Ghost- and Dark-type moves.</li>
	<li>Gengar is the favorite Pokémon of Ken Sugimori.</li>
	<li>In the Pokémon Red and Blue beta, Gengar was originally known as "Phantom".</li>
	<li>Gengar, along with Nidorino, with whom it battles in the beginning of Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, FireRed, and LeafGreen, originate from the Capsule Monsters manga, the precursor to the Pokémon franchise.</li>
	<li>Mega Gengar has the highest base Special Attack stat of all Ghost- and Poison-type Pokémon. It also has the highest base Speed stat of all Ghost-type Pokémon.</li>
	<li>Mega Gengar has the highest base stat total of all non-legendary Ghost-type Pokémon.</li>
	<li>When being escorted through Mt. Freeze and Murky Cave in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, Gengar knows Leer, Scratch, and Quick Attack, although it cannot learn those moves by any means in any generation.</li>
	<li>No other Pokémon has the same type combination as Gengar and its evolutionary relatives.</li>
	<li>Due to its unique type combination, Gengar and its evolutionary relatives are the only Ghost-type Pokémon that are weak against Psychic-type moves and also the only Poison-type Pokémon that are weak against Dark-type moves.</li>
	<li>When viewing Mega Gengar's Pokédex entry, the camera's view can only be moved sideways.</li>
