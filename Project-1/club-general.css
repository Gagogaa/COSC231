/*
- Each page should use one general style sheet (club-general.css) that applies a thematic flow to the pages
- i.e. If I choose to have a fan club for WarGreymon my club-general.css would apply to all of my pages:
- a yellow background
- curved, pointy, dinosaur talon-y font
- steel/metallic colored font for exciting headings
- maybe some cool metal looking :hover for my links
- *obviously, you won't be able to use WarGreymon, he's a Digimon*
- the club-general.css will be linked by every page, give it broad enough rules that will be used everywhere
- pages may have individual stylesheets (i.e. club-about.css), but no in-line style attributes
