TODO: strong em paragraph classLinks

lab 1
create an index page for your people account
it must be named index.html
it must contain at least the following:

- a paragraph about yourself
- emphasize and strong some of the words as appropriate
- an unordered list of your classes (with links to their pages if they have them)
- an ordered list of at least 4 things from your five year plan
- an image of you with your row
- a link to your 231 folder

This is not the order that things need to appear in your page, but all of the things do need to appear in your page at some point.
When looking at the source in firefox, no unclosed tags should appear red, and there should be proper indentation with nested elements.
